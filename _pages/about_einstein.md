Welcome to my Website! 

I am a 4th year PhD student in Economics at the University of Bologna, under the supervision of Prof. [Giuseppe Cavaliere](https://giuseppecavaliere.wixsite.com/giuseppe). 

My research is about Econometrics, with a specific focus on Nonparametric methods and Bootstrap inference.
